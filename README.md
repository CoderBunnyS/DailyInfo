# Random Activity Generator

This is a simple web application that fetches and displays a random activity suggestion using the [Bored API](https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Fetch a random activity from the Bored API.
- Display the activity suggestion on the webpage.
- Fetch a new activity when the user clicks a button.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Get Activity" button to fetch and display a random activity suggestion.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `myscripts.js` - The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching and displaying the activity suggestion.

## Notes

- The application uses the [All Origins](https://allorigins.win/) proxy to bypass CORS restrictions.
- A timestamp is added to the URL to ensure that each request is unique and not cached.
